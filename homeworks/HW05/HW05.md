2. Exercise

Calculate the number of trips by vendorID by hour(based on drop_off_date) in 2018.

Using the previous query, what was the daily(based on drop_off_date) mean, median, minimum, and maximum number of trips by vendorID in 2018?  

|drop_off_date|vendor_id| min_cnt_trip| mean_cnt_trip| max_cnt_trip|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|2018-01-01  |1  |4  |
|2018-01-01  |2  |5  |
...

What is the mean, median, minimum, and maximum trip_distance by vendor between 5:00 and 6:00 AM (not including 6:00 AM)?

What day in 2018 had the least / most amount of unique trips?


Hint: There is no explicit median function in PostgreSQL. Use the [percentile_count](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-aggregate.html) function instead.

2. Answer

First I attempted to group by tpep_dropoff_date_time, I used the following code and I recieved the proceeding chart,

```
SELECT extract("hour" from tpep_dropoff_datetime) as "hour_order", count(*) as "count"
FROM taxi_data td 
GROUP BY date_part('hour', tpep_dropoff_datetime);
```
