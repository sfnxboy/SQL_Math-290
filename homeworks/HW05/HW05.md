2. Exercise

Calculate the number of trips by vendorID by hour(based on drop_off_date) in 2018.

Using the previous query, what was the daily(based on drop_off_date) mean, median, minimum, and maximum number of trips by vendorID in 2018?  

|drop_off_date|vendor_id| min_cnt_trip| mean_cnt_trip| max_cnt_trip|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|2018-01-01  |1  |4  |
|2018-01-01  |2  |5  |
...

What is the mean, median, minimum, and maximum trip_distance by vendor between 5:00 and 6:00 AM (not including 6:00 AM)?

What day in 2018 had the least / most amount of unique trips?


Hint: There is no explicit median function in PostgreSQL. Use the [percentile_count](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-aggregate.html) function instead.

2. Answer

First I attempted to group by tpep_dropoff_date_time, I used the following code and I recieved the proceeding chart,

```
select extract("hour" from tpep_dropoff_datetime) as "hour_order", count(*) as "count"
from taxi_data td 
group by date_part('hour', tpep_dropoff_datetime);
```

I grouped by the hour value on the `tpep_dropoff_datetime` column using the [`date_part`](https://www.educba.com/postgresql-date_part/) function. Now I have to group by the `VendorID` column.

```
select "VendorID", extract("hour" from tpep_dropoff_datetime) as "hour", count(*) as cnt
from taxi_data 
where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2018
group by "VendorID", "hour";
```

SQL `group by` multiple columns is the technique which we can use to retrieve the summarized result set from the database involving the grouping of column values done by considering more than one column as grouping criteria. `group by` is done for clubbing together the records that have the same values for the criteria that are defined for grouping. When a single column is considered for grouping then the records containing the same value for that column on which criteria are defined are grouped into a single record for the resultset. Similarly, when the grouping criteria are defined on more than one column then all the values of those columns should be the same as that of other columns to consider them for grouping into a single record. 

- Now to answer: Using the previous query, what was the daily(based on drop_off_date) mean, median, minimum, and maximum number of trips by vendorID in 2018?

The SQL query can be found in the corresponding .sql file. We used a [CTE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cte-in-sql/) expression to structure the data in a format that is easier to query.

- Now to answer: What is the mean, median, minimum, and maximum trip_distance by vendor between 5:00 and 6:00 AM (not including 6:00 AM)?

![](https://github.com/sfnxboy/SQL_Math-290/blob/main/homeworks/HW05/images/sql_hw05_04.png)

We simply filtered for those rides by vendor between 5:00 and 6:00 AM (not including 6:00 AM), then outputted the mean, median, minimum, and maximum trip_distance per day per vendor ID, not filtering for those rides in 2018.

- Now to answer: What day in 2018 had the least / most amount of unique trips?

![](https://github.com/sfnxboy/SQL_Math-290/blob/main/homeworks/HW05/images/sql_hw05_05.png)

We used a CTE to get the count of trips per day, and we filtered to make sure the trip was in 2018. Then I used an inner join with another table that contained the minimum and maximum number of trips per any given day.

3. Exercise

What was the average tip percentage (tip_amount/total_amount) for unique trips in 2018?

What was the average  tip percentage by drop off hour for unique trips in 2018?
|drop_off_hour_of_day| average_tip_percentage |
|--|--|
|0:00  |15%  |
|1:00  |8%  |

...


Hint: use the [EXTRACT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-datetime.html) function to get the hour of the day from your timestamp.
