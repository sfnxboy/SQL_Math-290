1. Exercise

For each column in the database run the distinct command and record in a table how many distinct records are there. Your output should look like the one below.

|column_name|distinct_records  |
|--|--|
|vendorID  |3  |
|tpep_pickup_datetime  |?  |


...
While I will accept the solution with 17 `SELECT` statements I would encourage you to 
try and achieve this with as few `SELECT` statements as possible. Can you get the distinct count for all 17 columns from a single `SELECT`?

What can you deduce from the row count obtained from hw03 and the distinct record counts obtained in this exercise?

1. Answer

```
select 
count (distinct "VendorID") as VendorID,
count (distinct "tpep_pickup_datetime") as tpep_pickup_datetime,
count (distinct "tpep_dropoff_datetime") as tpep_dropoff_datetime,
count (distinct "passenger_count") as passenger_count,
count (distinct "trip_distance") as trip_distance,
count (distinct "RatecodeID") as RatecodeID,
count (distinct "store_and_fwd_flag") as store_and_fwd_flag,
count (distinct "PULocationID") as PULocationID,
count (distinct "DOLocationID") as DOLocationID,
count (distinct "payment_type") as payment_type,
count (distinct "fare_amount") as fare_amount,
count (distinct "extra") as extra,
count (distinct "mta_tax") as mta_tax,
count (distinct "tip_amount") as tip_amount,
count (distinct "improvement_surcharge") as improvement_surcharge,
count (distinct "total_amount") as total_amount
from taxi_data;
```

|column_name|distinct_records  |
|--|--|
|VendorID  |3  |
|tpep_pickup_datetime  |?  |
|tpep_dropoff_datetime  |3  |
|passenger_count  |?  |
|trip_distance  |3  |
|RatecodeID  |?  |
|store_and_fwd_flag  |3  |
|PULocationID  |?  |
|DOLocationID  |3  |
|payment_type  |?  |
|fare_amount  |3  |
|extra  |?  |
|mta_tax  |3  |
|tip_amount  |?  |
|tolls_amount  |3  |
|improvement_surcharge  |?  |
|total_amount  |?  |

2. Exercise

A subquery allows you to use the output from a previous query as input for another query. Here is one way of constructing a subquery:

```
select count(*) as distinct_observation_count from (select distinct "vendorID", "extra" from "qcmath290"."public"."2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data") as sub_query;
```

The query above will return the count of a distinct combination of vendorID and extra values in the `2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data` relation. It achieves this in two steps

 1. select the distinct combination of tuples of the vendorID and extra attributes
 2. count the results from step 1

Build a sub-query that will give you the distinct record count across all 17 columns in the 
`2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data` relation.

At this point, we know three crucial facts about our dataset:

 1. row count
 2. distinct count of observations in each column (aka cardinality of each column)
 3. total number of unique observations in the dataset

What can you deduce from these 3 key facts? 
Is there any single column in the dataset that could serve as the primary key?
Is there any combination of columns that can serve as the primary key?

3. Exercise

Use the `WHERE` clause introduced in the last class to find the answer to these questions. As a reminder, the most basic form of the where clause can be written like this:

`select * from students where f_name = 'Ronald'`

This query will return every record (tuple) from the students table (relation) where comparing the value found in f_name column with the string 'Ronald' evaluates to true.

 - How many rows have a "passenger_count" equal to 5.
 - How many distinct trips have a "passenger_count" greater than 3?
 - How many rows have a tpep_pickup_datetime between '2018-04-01 00:00:00' and '2018-05-01 00:00:00'?
 - How many distinct trips occurred in June where the tip_amount was greater than equal to $5.00?
 - How many distinct trips occurred in May where the passenger_count was greater than three and tip_amount was between $2.00 and $5.00?
 - What is the sum of tip_amount in the `2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data` dataset? (Hint: use the SUM() function to find the answer)
 
 Can you assume that the answer to your previous question is equivalent to the question of "How much tip did taxi drivers collected in total in 2018?" Explain your answer.
 
Please complete exercises 1-3 before you proceed to exercise 4.
