1. Exercise

For each column in the database run the distinct command and record in a table how many distinct records are there. Your output should look like the one below.

|column_name|distinct_records  |
|--|--|
|vendorID  |3  |
|tpep_pickup_datetime  |?  |


...
While I will accept the solution with 17 `SELECT` statements I would encourage you to 
try and achieve this with as few `SELECT` statements as possible. Can you get the distinct count for all 17 columns from a single `SELECT`?

What can you deduce from the row count obtained from hw03 and the distinct record counts obtained in this exercise?

1. Answer

```
select 
count (distinct "VendorID") as VendorID,
count (distinct "tpep_pickup_datetime") as tpep_pickup_datetime,
count (distinct "VendorID") as VendorID,
count (distinct "tpep_dropoff_datetime") as tpep_dropoff_datetime,
count (distinct "passenger_count") as passenger_count,
count (distinct "trip_distance") as trip_distance,
count (distinct "RatecodeID") as RatecodeID,
count (distinct "store_and_fwd_flag") as store_and_fwd_flag,
count (distinct "PULocationID") as PULocationID,
count (distinct "DOLocationID") as DOLocationID,
count (distinct "payment_type") as payment_type,
count (distinct "fare_amount") as fare_amount,
count (distinct "extra") as extra,
count (distinct "mta_tax") as mta_tax,
count (distinct "tip_amount") as tip_amount,
count (distinct "improvement_surcharge") as improvement_surcharge,
count (distinct "total_amount") as total_amount
from taxi_data;
```
