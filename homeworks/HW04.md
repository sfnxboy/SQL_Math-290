1. Exercise

For each column in the database run the distinct command and record in a table how many distinct records are there. Your output should look like the one below.

|column_name|distinct_records  |
|--|--|
|vendorID  |3  |
|tpep_pickup_datetime  |?  |


...
While I will accept the solution with 17 `SELECT` statements I would encourage you to 
try and achieve this with as few `SELECT` statements as possible. Can you get the distinct count for all 17 columns from a single `SELECT`?

What can you deduce from the row count obtained from hw03 and the distinct record counts obtained in this exercise?
