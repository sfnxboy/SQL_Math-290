For our first exercise we had to populate four spreadsheets on google sheets to begin documenting our knowledge base. There are four spreadsheets total.
 - `creators`: the primary key is the id column and relation has first_name, last_name, creator_name, and operating_system attributes. It has one row for every person who would create content in the Google Sheet. It has no foreign keys.
 - `errors`: the primary key is the id column and the relation has reporter_id, reported_date, error_message, short_description, and link_to_error_write_up attributes. The relation has one tuple for every error a creator experienced.  Reporter_id is the foreign key referencing the id field in the `creators` table. 
 - `error_resolution`: the primary key is the id column and the relation has error_id, reporter_id, resolution_link attributes. The relation has one tuple for every resolution a creator has reported.  It has two foreign keys error_id and reporter_id. Error_id references the id field in the `errors` relation and reporter_id references the id field in the `creators` relation.
 - `learning_point`: the primary key is the id column and the relation has creator_id, concept_name, short_description, link_to_explanation_document attributes. The relation has one tuple for every learning point a creator posted. It has a foreign key creator_id referencing the id field in the `creators` relation.

For now we don't create a schema for these relations/data files. I populated my information on a single row on the `creators` spreadsheet. **ADD ERROR**

The exercise was to complete the download and import of the 2018 yellow taxi dataset onto DBeaver. I completed this task last week.
